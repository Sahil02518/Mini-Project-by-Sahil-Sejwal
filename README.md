I have created an Image Classifier
I have created an image classifier for products related to fashion.
Image classification is an amazing application of deep learning. We can train a powerful algorithm to model a large image dataset. This model can then be used to classify a similar but unknown set of images.
I have built an Image classifier for the Fashion-MNIST Dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of Zalando's article images. It contains 60,000 images for the training set and 10,000 images for the test set data (we will discuss the test and training datasets along with the validation dataset later). These images belong to the labels of 10 different classes.
I have used convolutional neural networks(CNN)
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.
